Javascript Fireworks
A fun fireworks generator in javascript

You simply have to press the spacebar to launch a random rocket, or a number from 0 to 9 to launch a specific type of rocket :
- 0, 1 : one color, no trail of sparks
- 2, 3 : one color, with a trail of sparks
- 4 : bicolor, the inner fuses have a trail of sparks
- 5 : bicolor, the outer fuses have a trail of sparks
- 6 : multicolor, no trail of sparks
- 7 : multicolor, with a trail of sparks
- 8 : multicolor, with bright outer fuses having a trail of sparks
- 9 : multicolor, with bright inner fuses having a trail of sparks

For all rockets the colors are randomized.
When fuses die, they have 3 options, which are randomized :
 - they can simply die
 - they can randomly change direction
 - they can die leaving flickering sparks around them
 
 If you feel like it you can program a complete firework show, using and customizing the "launchFuse(int type)" function, that you can trigger with timecodes, there are many possibilities. Feel free to use as you please, enjoy !
